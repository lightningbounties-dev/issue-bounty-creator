// IMPORTANT: Storing API keys in client-side code is insecure and exposes them to anyone who visits the site.
// This is for local development and demonstration purposes ONLY.
//
// In a real-world, production application, you should move this API call to a secure backend server (like a
// Cloud Function, a Node.js server, etc.) where the API key can be stored safely as an environment variable.
// The client-side application would then make a request to YOUR server, which in turn would call the Gemini API.
